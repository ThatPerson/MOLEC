A very basic Molecular Orbital calculator. Kind of utilises the Hartree-Fock approximation.

The units used for energy are hartrees, and the units used for distance are 10^-11m - so the current model is calculating H2 bonding and antibonding energies, and once you account for the nuclear repulsion (1/r) it determines the bonding MO as -1.1hartree and the bond length as 7 units (=0.07nm).
